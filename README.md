On February 24, 2024, the China Space Administration officially announced that the name of the new aircraft for China’s manned lunar exploration mission was officially determined: “Mengzhou”

After an open call for selection, the name of the new aircraft for China's manned lunar exploration mission has recently been determined, and the new generation of manned spacecraft has been named "Mengzhou".

After the construction of the Chinese space station is completed, landing on the moon has become the next goal for the Chinese to explore space. As the lunar landing phase of the manned lunar exploration project is fully launched, the naming of new aircraft for manned lunar exploration is also on the agenda.

In August 2023, the China Manned Space Engineering Office launched a solicitation for new aircraft names for manned lunar exploration missions from the public, which attracted widespread attention and enthusiastic participation from the whole society, and received a total of applications from aerospace, science and technology, cultural communication and other fields. Nearly 2,000 contributions came from organizations and people from all walks of life. After expert selection and review, the new generation manned spacecraft was named "Dream Boat".

The name of the new aircraft has distinctive Chinese characteristics, characteristics of the times and cultural characteristics. "Dream Boat" means that manned lunar exploration carries the Chinese people's space dream and opens a new journey to explore space. It also reflects the systematic inheritance with the Shenzhou and Tianzhou spacecraft families.

At present, the Mengzhou spacecraft has fully entered the preliminary prototype development stage, and all work is progressing smoothly.
